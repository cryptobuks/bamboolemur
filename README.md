# Bamboo Lemur: Anonymous peer-to-peer chat

## About
The [bamboo lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_lemur) are medium-sized primates that live on Madagascar (and nowhere else).

They are called bamboo lemurs because they almost exclusively eat bamboo.

Although they can be active any time of the day, they are often active just after dawn.

Bamboo lemurs are known for their **respect to privacy** and cutting edge technologies like [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

## The project
This online chat suites bamboo lemurs perfectly for following reasons:
- It is serverless, which means it will scale to whatever number of users without  drop in performance;
- There is no database to keep your chat history, private data etc.;
- It is peer-to-peer which means quick and secure messaging;
- It is anonymous, does not require registration or login and will stay that way;
- It does not even store cookies, so relax and enjoy complete privacy;
