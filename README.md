# bamboolemur

The [bamboo lemurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_lemur) are medium-sized primates that live on Madagascar (and nowhere else).

They are called bamboo lemurs because they almost exclusively eat bamboo.

Although they can be active any time of the day, they are often active just after dawn.

Bamboo lemurs are known for their respect to privacy and cutting edge technologies like [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

This online chat suites them perfectly for following reasons:
- It is serverless, which means it will scale to whatever number of users without  drop in performance;
- It is peer-to-peer which means there is no database to keep the messages, chat history etc;
- It is anonymous, does not require registration or login and will stay that way.

You can start using the chat already by going to [bamboolemur.com](http://bamboolemur.com) and sharing the chat room URL with your friends.
